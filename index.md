The history of the Haitian revolution is full of rich and inspiring stories of revolutionaries. However, throughout the years these rich histories have slowly disappeared from textbooks all over the world. Today Haiti is one of the poorest countries in the world and needs assistance, in forms of money, medical aid and food from many of the worldâ€™s global superpowers. However, without proper research, the youth of today will only know these negative aspects of the worlds first Black dominated democracy. Romanticism, or better known as Western Hegemony is often considered as history that is written to relate or cater to one niche of society.  Writers of the Haitian Revolution romanticized the history of the war in order to ease western tensions of an impending worldwide slave revolt. Western Hegemony diluted the once African rich history of the Haitian revolution and caused historical amnesia throughout the world. Haitian culture has suffered from this amnesia, and unfortunately struggles from misconceptions to this day.
